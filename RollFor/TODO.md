1. Disable the loot frame when rolling.
2. Make loot messages less verbose - if below threshold, then don't display.
3. Add a safety mechanism not to reset awarded loot if the SR list is re-imported.
4. Add HR surprise tooltips.
5. Fix the color codes lol becuz it's the highest prio lol.
6. Mark winners in the player selection list.
7. Link LootFrame and RollingPopup interactions so we don't end up in loot frame selected but no popup bug.
