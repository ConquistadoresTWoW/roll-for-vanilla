# TODO

1. Add config GUI.
2. Add LootReceived GUI (requested for +1).
3. Add note support (requested).


## Critical for the release

0. Update README.
1. Mark winners in the player selection list.
2. Add a safety mechanism not to reset awarded loot if the SR list is re-imported.
3. Disable the loot frame when rolling.
4. Link LootFrame and RollingPopup interactions so we don't end up in loot frame selected but no popup bug.
