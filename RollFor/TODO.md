# TODO

1. Link LootFrame and RollingPopup interactions so we don't end up in loot frame selected but no popup bug.
2. Make loot messages less verbose - if below threshold, then don't display.
3. Mark winners in the player selection list.
4. Add a safety mechanism not to reset awarded loot if the SR list is re-imported.
5. Disable the loot frame when rolling.
