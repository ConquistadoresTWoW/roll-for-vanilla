# TODO

1. Fix SR info in the LootFrame if 2 items dropped and 2 different players soft res it (works currently in DroppedLootAnnounce - replicate that).
2. Disable the loot frame when rolling.
3. Add awarding support for multiple winners.
4. Make loot messages less verbose - if below threshold, then don't display.
5. Add a safety mechanism not to reset awarded loot if the SR list is re-imported.
6. Fix auto-master loot enabling it in Durotar.
7. Fix the winner button for single-SR winners.
8. Make sure to show/hide award buttons on lootopen/close.
9. When rolling is finished and winner determined and we close the popup and reopen with the same item the data is cleared. Persist the data until awarded.
10. When awarding the item via player selection and aborting, the rolling popup doesn't show back up, the item is still selected on the list.
11. When one player is soft ressing and two items dropped it doesn't ask to award, but rather it asks the player to roll lol.
12. Add HR surprise tooltips.
